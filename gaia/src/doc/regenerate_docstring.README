IMPORTANT NOTE:

usage of this script is a bit peculiar.
when you want to regenerate the docstrings, you first need to compile and install the
latest version of the python bindings.
Then you need to call this script, and finally you need to recompile the python bindings.

It is a good idea to only do this before a tag, as the file containing the docstrings
is committed to the repo as well.
