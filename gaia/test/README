There are 3 folders here:

 - unittest: this contains all the unittests for Gaia, they are written in python
 - scratch: this contains some examples and test scripts; they might be outdated
            and not working anymore and should not even be considered as examples
 - evaladata: this contains data from some evaluation which are MTG specific and
              do not pertain in the src/ directory, but were looking for a git home
