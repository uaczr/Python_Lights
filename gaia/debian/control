Description: General library to work with points in a semimetric space
 Gaia is a general library that allows you to work with points in a semimetric
 space. The points have any number of attributes, each one having a name and a
 type, which can be either one of those three: real number, string,
 enumeration. In simple words, Gaia allows you to define the following:
 .
  * a structure for your space, which will be determined by the PointLayout.
    Each point has exactly one PointLayout, and as such, points which share the
    same layout are said to be in the same space. A PointLayout actually
    contains a list of dimensions (real or string) which contains attributes of
    each point, as well as their associated names and a tree structure to
    organize them (which you can forget about if you don't care for a specific
    reason)
  * a DataSet, which is basically a collection of Points. All Points in a
    DataSet share the same layout.
  * Transformations, which allow you to take Points in a DataSet (or the whole
    DataSet) and apply them a transformation that returns a new Point (or
    DataSet) in a possibly different output space (eg: with a different
    PointLayout)
  * distance functions, which return the distance between two points in a
    specific space
